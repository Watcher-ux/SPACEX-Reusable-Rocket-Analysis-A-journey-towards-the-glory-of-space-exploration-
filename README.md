# SPACEX Reusable Rocket Analysis  
*A journey toward the glory of space exploration*

This project explores the story behind SpaceX’s reusable rockets through data—examining how these steel giants rise, return, and reshape the future of spaceflight. Using launch data from SpaceX and public sources, the analysis uncovers patterns, probabilities, and the engineering brilliance behind each landing attempt.

## 📌 Project Overview
This capstone covers the full data-science workflow:
- **Data Exploration** – Launch history, mission details, landing outcomes  
- **Visualizations** – Trend-revealing plots on reuse, reliability, performance and launching/landing outcomes.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Machine-learning models estimating landing success  
- **Insights** – Observations on cost efficiency, booster evolution, and reuse patterns  

## 📁 Contents
- Jupyter notebooks  
- Visualizations and model outputs  
- Cleaned datasets or dataset links  
- Summary findings and interpretations  

## 🌐 Data Sources
This project uses publicly available information from:
- SpaceX launch data  
- Wikipedia (supporting mission info)  
- Dataset links provided in the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**

Some starter code snippets originate from IBM course notebooks and appear here strictly for educational and portfolio purposes.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository acts as a capstone showcase—demonstrating applied data science, storytelling through data, and the fascination of watching rockets master the art of coming home.

## NOTE: Here in all notebooks, the dataset links have been provided by @IBM SkillsNetwork, instead of using the links it is better to download and use the datasets provided within the repository(just configure the file path accordingly).
## This project is a part of the IBM DataScience Capstone by Coursera
